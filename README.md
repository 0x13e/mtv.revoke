### DeFi on [MultiVAC](https://mtv.ac) is just getting started, stay safe out there.  

[revoke.mtv](https://0x13e.github.io/mtv.revoke/) provides a simple tool to revoke an authorized spender from your wallet on the MultiVAC blockchain.
 
#### Interacted with a new DEX?

You authorized one or more of their contracts to spend a given amount to perform the swap. Often the request you approve in your dApp browser is set to unlimited. Consider limiting or revoking the spending amount outright. 

***Future Plans***

Host newly deployed MTV smart contracts and provide a simple byte-code comparison tool and a link to the contract source. While this doesn't guarantee you're interacting with a good contract, the source will at least be available to inspect before approving any functions.
